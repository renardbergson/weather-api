## Take a look at this project in action:

### link: https://renardbergson.github.io/weather-api/


## What technologies did We use to build this project

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- SASS / CSS

- Flexbox

- HTML DOM

- Javascript

- API Request
    * [open weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
    * [big data cloud](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/)

## WHat We learned

- how to request an API;

- how to implement SASS;

## What is missing

- Actually, it's not possible to search for a city and its state or province together (maybe, this is because that kind of function is not free of charge to use)
